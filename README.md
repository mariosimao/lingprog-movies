# Movie Catalog

## 1. Introduction

This is a small CLI application to organize movies on a catalog.

Movies contain a name, production company and are rated.

The catalog has a fixed size and is persisted into a CSV file.

Developed by Mario Sim√£o for the Programming Languages class, during the Computer
and Electronic Engineering course at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

## 2. Compilation

To compile, execute:

```bash
$ make all
```

## 3. Usage

```bash
$ ./catalog help
```

or

```bash
$ ./catalog <catalog-name> <command> [<args>]
```

Where `<catalog-name>` should be the name of your catalog.

More information about available commands are given below.

### 3.1. help

Displays information about all commands.

```bash
$ ./catalog help
```

### 3.2. create

Creates a new catalog and its corresponding CSV file.

**Warning:** This is a destructive command. If a catalog with same name already
exists, it will be deleted and a new one will be created.

```bash
$ ./catalog <catalog-name> create <size>
```

Example:

```bash
$ ./catalog my-movies create 100
```

The application will create a catalog with capacity for 100 movies.

Also, a `my-movies.csv` file will be created on the same directory.

### 3.3. add

```bash
$ ./catalog <catalog-name> add

Example:

```bash
$ ./catalog my-movies add

```
Add movie to catalog
* Name: Harry Potter
* Production: Warner Bros
* Rating: 8.9
```

### 3.4. bulk-add

Inserts multiple movies into the catalog. The amount of movies should be informed
previously. The application will prompt multiple times asking for movie information.

```bash
$ ./catalog <catalog-name> bulk-add <amount-of-movies>
```

```bash
$ ./catalog my-movies bulk-add 5
```

Will prompt 5 times asking for movie data.

### 3.5. list
